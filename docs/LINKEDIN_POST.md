🚨 **Project Launch: A.E.G.I.S. - AI for Disaster Prediction** 🚨

I'm excited to share **Project A.E.G.I.S.**, an advanced computer vision system designed to predict and analyze natural disasters in real-time.

Instead of just classifying images, A.E.G.I.S. uses **V-JEPA** (Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) to understand the *physics* and *temporal dynamics* of events like floods, wildfires, and earthquakes.

**Key Features:**
✅ **Physics-Aware AI:** Predicts future video embeddings to understand causality.
✅ **Edge-Ready:** Runs on low-power devices using INT8 quantization and ONNX.
✅ **Natural Language Alerts:** Integrated VLM (Llama 3.1) generates human-readable warnings.
✅ **Full Pipeline:** From YouTube data scraping to Kubernetes deployment.

I built this completely open-source to help advance AI for social good. We need smarter systems protecting our planet. 🌍
